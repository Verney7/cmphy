Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of cmphy. The
first step to using any software is getting it properly installed.

Get the source code
-------------------

cmphy is hosted on GitHub, where the code is always `available
<https://github.com/fellobos/cmphy>`_.

Clone the public repository to get a local copy of the source:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/fellobos/cmphy.git

Once you have it, you can embed cmphy in your own Python package, or
install it into your site-packages easily:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd cmphy
    $ python setup.py install
